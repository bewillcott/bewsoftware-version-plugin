# Your Manual

It is advisable that the first file you create be this file.  Since the final
'jar' file will contain a stand-alone http server, it will be looking for
the `index.html` file to serve up first.

This however is **not** a requirement.  If you want your end-users to get a
listing of the files in the 'jar' file, then you don't need this file.

[**Examples**]
